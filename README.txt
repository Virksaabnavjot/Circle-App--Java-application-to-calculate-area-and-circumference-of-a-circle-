This is the java application to calculate area and circumference of the circle using oop principle of java programming

//Note: Area of Circle A= Pi (r * r) , Circumference = (2 * PI * r)

This application contains two java classes 

1-CircleApp.java (The main class )
2-Circle.java (The instansible class with constructor)

In the application we declare the required varibles and then create a object.Which is used for doing calculations
to keep the main class neat and tidy as we know, or if someone doesn't know when we create a instance of a class 
we can use any method of that class in the main class/ whichever class we created the instance in and call the methods anytime

for example in this example we do,

//declare Objects
Circle myCircle;
//create objects
myCircle= new Circle();

classic example 
myCircle.calculateArea();
myCircle.calculateCircumference();
